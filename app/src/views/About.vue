      Accessible Wayfinding: McMapping Edition is a route-finding application, compliant with guidelines laid out in the Americans with Disabilities Act Standards for Accessible Design, that provides users with accessible routes within McMicken Hall. The University of Cincinnati's recent accessibility initiative uncovered a significant need for inclusive wayfinding. A 2019 study conducted by EduCause, a third-party non-profit, found “...half of the 40,000 students surveyed rated their institution negatively in terms of accessibility.” 
        <br><br>
      While the University of Cincinnati is taking steps to correct this weakness, the current initiative does not offer interior routes around McMicken. Our application will allow users to find classrooms, bathrooms, and meeting rooms as well as provide a route from their current location based on their accessibility needs. Users can even create a personalized profile, allowing them to save routes and quickly pull them up on the website or the downloaded mobile application.
